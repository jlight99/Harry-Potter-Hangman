### Sorting Ceremony
The Sorting Ceremony, in which the user may either choose to be Sorted by the Hat, or choose their own fate by selecting one of the four Houses from the emblem. This can be done by either clicking the corresponding images, or by entering ‘?’ to be Sorted by the Hat or ‘G’ for Gryffindor, ‘R’ for Ravenclaw, ‘H’ for Hufflepuff or ‘S’ for Slytherin. 

**Fun fact:** this entire game can be played without having to use the mouse once!

### Different Modes
The hangman portion of the game has three modes: guessing from all the characters, guessing only characters from the user’s own House, as determined by the earlier Sorting, and guessing only the Quidditch players

### Guess
As the user endeavours to unveil the identity of the mystery character, every wrong guess brings the sinister stick-figure one limb closer to formation…
